But the kind of math that\'s useful in programming is not what they teach you in school. In fact it\'s much more interesting. Category theory seems to be esoteric when presented by mathematicians, because all their examples come from other branches of mathematics. But when you use examples from programming, things suddenly becomes quite obvious. And the reason there is such a close fit between category theory and programming is quite simple: both are built on the principle of composability.\n\nCompiling like a boss!\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JH\_Ou17\_zyU/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JH\_Ou17\_zyU?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JH\_Ou17\_zyU?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\" style=\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778},\"caption\":\"A Crash Course in Category Theory by Bartosz Milewski at Scala.io\"}" %}

## About

I want to learn Category Theory, Functional Programming, and Scala.

* [ ] scala - [https://www.scala-lang.org/](https://www.scala-lang.org/) 
* [ ] category theory - [https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)
* [ ] some FP - [https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)

## And to make sure we stand on the shoulders of giants:

_\(We can check them off as we absorb their smarticles\)_

* \[X\] others already doing this in scala [https://github.com/elbaulp/Scala-Category-Theory](https://github.com/elbaulp/Scala-Category-Theory)
* \[X\] others compiling nice books  [https://github.com/onlurking/category-theory-for-programmers](https://github.com/onlurking/category-theory-for-programmers) 
* [ ] reading great blogs [https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/) 
* [ ] making cool courses [https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)
* [ ] writing about languages they designed [https://www.artima.com/shop/programming\_in\_scala\_3ed](https://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_3ed) 
* [ ] letting you run excercises in your browser [https://www.scala-exercises.org/fp\_in\_scala/getting\_started\_with\_functional\_programming](https://www.scala-exercises.org/fp_in_scala/getting_started_with_functional_programming) 
* [ ] writing books that need to be read [https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) 
* [ ] and the code that needs to be run [https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala) 

## Getting Started

PLEASE :heart: submit a pull request or issue, just to say hi :smiley:

### Part 1

Merging [https://github.com/elbaulp/Scala-Category-Theory](https://github.com/elbaulp/Scala-Category-Theory) and [https://github.com/onlurking/category-theory-for-programmers](https://github.com/onlurking/category-theory-for-programmers) so we can have one giant happy repo where we can

* [ ] Read _Category Theory for Programmers_
* [ ] Run, fiddle with, or extend the code in `scala` \(but trying `golang` crossed my mind\)
