## And to make sure we stand on the shoulders of giants:  
*(We can check them off as we absorb their smarticles)*
- [X] others already doing this in scala https://github.com/elbaulp/Scala-Category-Theory
- [X] others compiling nice books  https://github.com/onlurking/category-theory-for-programmers 
- [ ] reading great blogs https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/ 
- [ ] making cool courses https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1
- [ ] writing about languages they designed https://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_3ed 
- [ ] letting you run excercises in your browser https://www.scala-exercises.org/fp_in_scala/getting_started_with_functional_programming 
- [ ] writing books that need to be read https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala 
- [ ] and the code that needs to be run https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala 

## Getting Started 

PLEASE :heart: submit a pull request or issue, just to say hi :smiley: 

### Part 1

Merging https://github.com/elbaulp/Scala-Category-Theory and https://github.com/onlurking/category-theory-for-programmers so we 
can have one giant happy repo where we can 
- [ ] Read *Category Theory for Programmers*
- [ ] Run, fiddle with, or extend the code in `scala` (but trying `golang` crossed my mind)
