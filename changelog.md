## 2018-05-22

I keep getting lost with definitions - I need a definition repository.  None of the current solutions on the itnernet seem great. there is the stanford encyclopedia, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-theory/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-theory/), and a few texts online.... actually this repo could do with a resources section

## ORIGIN

### **Vision** for project

I want to be able to:

* read _Category Theory for Programmers_
* take notes in the book
* execute code from the book

### **Resources** used/to use

To run the code in the book is possible but a lot of work unless we use something like Jupyter/Zeppelin Notebooks which could be really cool - but is it necessary?

if we go docusaurus/hugo the code could be formatted really pretty but I don't know if we can make that executable... There doesn't seem to be that much emphasis on code in the books anyways
